      <p>Financial speculators and military officials have always been concerned with how other countries' changes in wealth might disrupt the international status quo. For Western states in recent times, all eyes have been on China as its explosive economic growth pushes it further towards securing a regional hegemony and significant military projection power. Those familiar with history see this not so much unexpected as inevitable: China has been the wealthiest, most populated, and most technologically advanced region in the world until only relatively recently, when European colonialism began to funnel wealth Westward. 
          <br> 
    <p>This map was esentially made to answer the question of which modern states can be expected to achieve rapid economic and political gains in the same manner that China has over the past thirty years. Using a methodology that would raise serious objections from actual practicing political and social scientists, I calculated this likelihood based on my own index, calculated with four variables: economic complexity, industrial growth rate, population growth rate and existing population pool.
    <br>
    As one can be seen in the above map, not every country is expected to be a winner, and the two obvious choices for continued growth - China and India - had the highest index scores, with India beating China by a significant margin. As for more regionalized powers, my own results suggest to keep a close eye on North Africa, East Africa, Southeast Asia, Iran, Pakistan and Brazil.
